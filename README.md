### Category: Machine Learning

### Skills Required:
Flask Integration,IBM Nodered,IBM Watson Studio,IBM Machine Learning,IBM Cloud Object Storage

### Project Description
In this, we need to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Diabetes. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

### Solution Requirements:
Develop an end-to-end web application that predicts the probability of females having diabetes. The application must be built with Python-Flask or Django framework with the machine learning model trained & deployed on IBM Watson Studio.
